### Sprive Backend

This implementation is the backend that powers all of the [sprive applications](https://github.com/lucspt?q=sprive&type=all&language=&sort=):

- [Carbon management web application (for business)](https://github.com/lucspt/sprive-web)
- [Daily carbon tracker](https://github.com/lucspt/sprive-mobile)


All these apps were created through my passion for the climate!


Note: All emissions calculations provided by this backend, and therefore the apps which use it, are randomly generated.

Built with:
  - Python
  - Flask
