# Sprive Backend

This repository holds the backend code that powers all of my Sprive applications:

- [Business Carbon management software](https://github.com/lucspt/sprive-web)
- [Mobile carbon footprint tracker](https://github.com/lucspt/sprive-mobile)


All these apps were created through my ever-growing passion for the climate! Let me know what you think. 


Note: All emissions calculations provided by this backend, and therefore the apps which use it, are randomly generated.

Built with:
  - Python (Flask)
